# IoT Health Monitoring System ðŸ©ºðŸ’“

This is a simple IoT project I built to monitor **body temperature** and **heart rate** in real time.  
It uses an **ESP32 board**, a **Pulse Sensor**, and a **DHT11 temperature sensor**. The readings are sent to the **Blynk IoT Cloud**, so you can see the live data from anywhere using your phone or laptop.

## Why I Built This
In many rural areas or situations where hospital monitoring equipment isnâ€™t available, having a small, portable, and affordable device that can track basic health parameters can be very useful. This project is my attempt at creating one.

---

## What It Can Do
- Show live **temperature** and **heart rate** readings.
- Send the data to the cloud using **Wi-Fi**.
- Display the readings on a **Blynk dashboard**.
- Trigger alerts if the readings go outside normal ranges.

## What You Need
**Hardware**
- ESP32 development board
- Pulse Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Micro-USB cable for programming

**Software**
- Arduino IDE (for writing and uploading the code)
- Blynk IoT app (for Android/iOS)
- Required Arduino libraries:
  - `BlynkSimpleEsp32.h`
  - `WiFi.h`
  - `DHT.h`

How I Connected It 

The VCC pin of the pulse sensor is connected to the 3.3V pin of the ESP32.
The GND pin of the pulse sensor goes to the GND pin on the ESP32.
The signal wire of the pulse sensor is connected to GPIO 34 on the ESP32.
The data pin of the DHT11 temperature sensor is connected to GPIO 4.
The VCC pin of the DHT11 is connected to 3.3V on the ESP32.
The GND pin of the DHT11 is connected to the GND pin on the ESP32.

## How to Run It
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `IoT_Health_Monitor.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries from the Library Manager.
4. Enter your Wi-Fi name, password, and Blynk Auth Token in the code.
5. Upload the code to the ESP32.
6. Open the Blynk app and create a dashboard with widgets for temperature and heart rate.
7. Start monitoring live data from your phone.
